# Systematic testing
**Systematic testing is a planned and systematic process with the explicit goal of finding defects in some well_defined part of the system**

This is a destructive process. Here the success is to find defects in the program, and prove that it does not work.

# Unit under test (UUT)
The specific unit we are currently running the test on.
# Equivalence class (EC)
**A subset of all possible inputs to the UUT that has the property that if one element in the subset demonstrates a defect during testing, then we assume that all other elements in the subset will demonstrate the same defect**

# Boundary value
**A boundary value is an element that lies right on or next to the edge of an equivalence class**
