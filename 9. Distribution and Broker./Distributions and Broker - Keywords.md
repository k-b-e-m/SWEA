# Marshalling
**Is the process of taking a collection of structured data items and assembling them into a byte array suitable for transmission in a networks message**

# Unmarshalling

# A Future
A concept in Software-engineering which represents the answer to a request which may  take a long time to compute. The Future can then be polled to see if the answer has become available, once it is the answer can be received. The purpose of a Future is to avoid the client block for a long time while the answer is being computed.

# Multi Type Dispatching
When using Multi Type Dispatching, we are using a "super" invoker that delegates to subInvokers. In hotstone for example we had the card, game and hero Invokers. Prevents the blob.

# Socket
Javas fundamental network implementation.
Normally, a server runs on a specific computer and has a socket that is bound to a specific port number. The server just waits, listening to the socket for a client to make a connection request.

# Uniform Resource Locators (URL)
follows the URI schema and identifies both the resource’s location as well as the means for retrieving it. One such example resource is the ’contact’ homepage retrieved above at http://www.baerbak.com/contact.html. It states that the resource “contact.html” can be found on the web server “www.baerbak.com” and the means to retrieve it is the HTTP protocol.
