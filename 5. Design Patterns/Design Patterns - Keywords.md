# Behavioural Pattern
These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

# Creational Pattern
These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

# Structural Pattern
These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.
